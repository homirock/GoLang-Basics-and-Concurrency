//The function that is called with the varying number of arguments is known as variadic function.
// Or in other words, a user is allowed to pass zero or more arguments in the variadic function. 
//fmt.Printf,Println is an example of the variadic function, it required one fixed argument at the starting after 
//that it can accept any number of arguments. 

//Important Points: In the declaration of the variadic function, the type of the last parameter is preceded by an ellipsis,
// i.e, (â€¦). It indicates that the function can be called at any number of parameters of this type. 

//Syntax:  

//function function_name(para1, para2...type)type {// code...}
